/*Probability of getting at least K heads in N tosses of Coins
Given N number of coins, the task is to find probability of getting at least K number of heads after tossing all the N coins simultaneously.
Suppose we have 3 unbiased coins and we have to
find the probability of getting at least 2 heads,
so there are 23 = 8 ways to toss these
coins, i.e.,
HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT 

Out of which there are 4 set which contain at
least 2 Heads i.e.,
HHH, HHT, HH, THH

So the probability is 4/8 or 0.5
Time Complexity: O(n) where n < 20
Auxiliary space: O(n)
